# 🍎 How to Install AltStore (macOS)

1. Download [AltServer for macOS](https://cdn.altstore.io/file/altstore/altserver.zip).&#x20;
2. Copy `AltServer.app` to your `/Applications` folder.&#x20;

// I don't think we need a video here, it's visually busy b/c they all have the same thumbnail.

3. Launch AltServer. It will appear as an icon in the menu bar.

4\. Connect your iOS device to your computer and make sure it is unlocked. Trust your device with your computer if needed.

5\. Enable "Wi-Fi Sync" on your device.

{% hint style="info" %}
**(macOS 10.14 Mojave or earlier)**  
Open iTunes, then enable “Sync with this iPhone/iPad over Wi-Fi” for your device.
{% endhint %}

Open Finder, then enable “Show this iPhone/iPad when on WiFi” for your device.
{% endhint %}

7\. Click the AltServer icon in the Mac menu bar, go to “Install AltStore…”, then click the iPhone or iPad you want to install AltStore onto.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**** [**For "Install Mail Plug-in…" notification, follow the instructions on next page.**](enable-mail-plug-in.md)****
{% endhint %}

8\. Enter your Apple ID email address and password. This will allow AltServer to authenticate with Apple and configure your account to support sideloading apps.

{% hint style="info" %}
Both your email address and password are case sensitive.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Apple ID and password are sent **only** to Apple — not us or anyone else.
{% endhint %}

10\. Wait a few seconds, then an AltServer notification should appear on your Mac saying AltStore has been successfully installed onto your device.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't see any notifications from AltServer, make sure you've given AltServer permission to send you notifications in System Preferences.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You may need to restart your device to make AltStore appear on your Home Screen.
{% endhint %}

11\.  On your iOS device, go to Settings -> General -> Profiles & Device Management. Tap “Trust [Your Apple ID],” then tap “Trust” again to confirm.

{% hint style="info" %}
The "Profiles & Device Management" may read as a number of things depending on your version, but you can always find the section near the bottom of your General settings tab.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
