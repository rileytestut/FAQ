# üèé AltJIT

AltJIT allows apps sideloaded with AltStore to enable just-in-time compilation, more commonly known as JIT. JIT allows some apps to run significantly faster ‚Äî or even at all ‚Äî but iOS does not normally allow apps to use JIT for security reasons. AltJIT is an AltStore-specific workaround that allows you to enable JIT for any sideloaded app whenever you're on the same WiFi as AltServer.

To use AltJIT, open the "My Apps" tab then long-press the app you want to use JIT. Press "Enable JIT" to launch the app in the foreground, and within a few seconds you should see an AltStore notification saying JIT has been enabled. The app can now use any JIT-related features without crashing.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once enabled, an app can continue using JIT until it is force-quit from the app switcher or purged from memory while suspended in the background.
{% endhint %}
