# ðŸ†” AppIDs

Each app you install through AltStore also uses up some number of "App IDs" when they are downloaded. **You can only use a total of 10 App IDs per week,** and each app uses a different amount of App IDs. Press "View App IDs" in the "My Apps" tab to see how many each app is using.&#x20;
